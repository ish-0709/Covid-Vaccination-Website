## Description

This project is a solution to the already existing problems of overcrowding and lack of social distance at the vaccination centers, in our minds we had this notion that we can make this endeavour of life saving vaccination smoother and less of a heckle.

## Problems that we looked upon and resolved

The first problem that we looked upon was the issue of crowding at the vaccination centers, so we introduced the system of providing everyone with a token of their own and live token tracking on the website so they can know when they’re to arrive at their spot in accordance with the time left and the ongoing token. 

Secondly, we thought that the people who used to drive at the vaccination centers, thereby creating a parking issue at the center itself could be resolved. Hence we thought of directing the crowd from the center to a bigger parking area, like that of a mall. Here the people need not come out of the car and can get vaccinated by sitting in the car itself. Thus, solving two problems, one that of maintaining social-distances as well as overcrowding at the vaccination centers.

Further, the older people and the differently abled people who were having issues of commute, we thought that they could be helped by providing them with mobile vans that can do door to door vaccination at the ease of never leaving their society premises.

## Working Of the Website
Website name - Vaccine on the Go

1) The website opens on the mainpage. Going with the trend of minimalistic and lite design. 
2) We went with a user-friendly front page with just two buttons, a login button for the new user and the other register your shot button for the person who is already registered.
3) We have two login portals, one for the healthcare workers who’ll be sitting at the center as well as one for the user who will book his/her own vaccine.
4) If you are a new user you can go to the Sign Up page where your registration will be done with your aadhar card number,age and city.Once registered each person will get a secret code which will be needed at the vaccination site for verification.
5) After registering you will be taken to a Registration page where you have two options either you can choose to drive through vaccination or walk in vaccination simply by a check button.
6) Here you can filter the centres available in your city by searching through PIN or simply choose another centre if the slots are empty there.On the right side of the page there is a map of all the centers in that city.If you choose Drive Through Vaccination method you will see the malls nearby you that acts like a Vaccination center.
7) If you are a PWD candidate you can checkmark the button on the signup page and hence you will be directed to the page of Van System .Similarly for older people whose age is greater than 70 they will also be directed to the Van system page.
8) The van system is made for the ease of older people and differently abled candidates.
9) Here for each locality of the entire city a calendar list is provided showing on what date the van will come to which colony and the people can register at their respective colonies . By chance if their date is missed for that day,the person has an option to choose the centre.
10) After the complete registration process is done and the vaccine slot is booked the user will be directed to the user dashboard where the details of the vaccine he booked can be seen. Every night at 12 am the token numbers will be allotted for the next day.
11) The live token system will start from 9am with the first person being vaccinated.And hence the user can track how many people are left before him to be vaccinated hence solving the problem of overcrowding at the respective centres.
12) For the admin every health worker is provided with a health code and hence they can access the computers with it .To verify the people the admin will enter the AADHAR Number of the respective person as well as their secret code.
13) And as soon as these details are entered and verified BOOM!! One patient is vaccinated and hence the token number will increase as well as changes in database will occur.
